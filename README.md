WSSERVER
---------------

This is the code for really SIMPLE (and useless) WebSocket server. It was built to exemplify the usage of the [wsock](https://github.com/madtrick/wsock) library.

To run it: compile, open an emulator and type:

```erlang
1>wsserver:start_link()
```

It will be listening at *localhost:8081*
